# Hyperapp - learing and play

As a fan of lightweight, fast, and minimal but powerful development,
when I found [hyperapp](https://hyperapp.dev/) I was intrigued.
This is just a small repo to get started experimenting, playing, and
hopefully learning.

## How I start

When I'm working/playing around with something like this, I often use [devd](https://github.com/cortesi/devd) so I don't have to refresh the browser. As I explore the tooling, this may change, but for now I like it.

You can run `devd -io .` from the project directory. This will open a
browser window with the project, and will auto-refresh when you save
changes to a file in the project.
